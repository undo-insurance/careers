# Scala Backend engineer |> (‚à©ÔΩÄ-¬¥)‚äÉ‚îÅ‚òÜÔæü.*ÔΩ•ÔΩ°Ôæü

## Job description
Undo is the insurance provider of the future üîÆ We aim to democratize insurance by making it **transparent**, **fair** and **easy**. In addition we want to reinvent insurance as a concept by designing products and experiences that can only be realized by maneuvering on the **bleeding edge of technology**.

We've received 25M DKK in funding from [Tryg](https://tryg.dk), who's one of the biggest insurance providers in the nordics. From a technical point of view we have very few touch points with their existing technical infrastructure. Our entire tech stack has been built from the ground up by ourselves. Instead we are leveraging their immense insurance expertise along with our knowledge about technology and digital markets to tailor a revolutionized insurance onboarding and continued user experience. As a result we've seen a growth rate of 30-50% MOM for over 6 consecutive months at the time of writing üìà

We‚Äôre looking for skilled backend engineers that want to take part in our journey and not only join a small, ambitious, and close-knit team of developers, but also a family of 14 caring and passionate people that want to enable others to live life carefree. We're currently situated in Copenhagen @[Spaces](https://www.spacesworks.com/da/koebenhavn/ny-carlsberg-vej/) in the newly renovated Carlsberg City District - a place pulsing with entrepreneurial spirit and drive.

You‚Äôll be helping us expand upon our feature set, while contributing to a high degree of maintainability, robustness, and scalability in order to ensure the continued service of our customers. The services we provide can make a huge impact in our customers lives and can be expected to be carried out in moments of dire need. As a result, our product and its foundation needs to be operational and dependable at all times ‚òùüèº

Our codebase consists mainly of Scala code, and you‚Äôll be working almost exclusively with that language ü§ì That being said, we believe in choosing the right tools for the job, and we do have both Node.js and Python code in production as well. Following is a list of some of the most prevalent technologies we use in our day-to-day work:

* Scala libraries
	* [Sangria (GraphQL)](https://sangria-graphql.org/)
	* [Slick](http://slick.lightbend.com/)
* PostgreSQL
* AWS
	* Beanstalk
	* Lambda
	* SNS
* Github
* CircleCI

Using these technologies your daily work will consist mainly of producing code that enables new and awesome features üíª In addition you can expect to be reviewing the code of your co-developers in order to uphold the standards of our codebase and to help your them hone their skills, and you should expect the same from them. As developers we value a frequent feedback loop, as it improves a unified understanding and shared responsibility for the codebase.

Besides working with code you'll be a part of our product development process, where you'll be expected to estimate and prioritize new features and improvements to our product. We use OKRs to govern this process, so you can expect decisions to be highly data driven. Lastly, when developing new features we use a framework akin to Google Design Sprints, and you can expect to be part of feature development from a very early stage. We want people from all parts of our organization to participate in these sprints in order to get the most coherent and thought-through user experience üí°
